  "Is My Church or Pastor My Covering?",
  "Did you know that a covering is *not* just one person?",
  "🌟 Your true covering is your Godly community—not just your church service or your Pastor alone.",
  "🙌 Think about it... your Pastor might not even know your full name, but your community does. When God wants to reach you, He often speaks through the people you *actually do life with*.",
  "📖 A true covering includes people who know you, love you, and walk with you daily—not just on Sundays.",
  "🎉 Thank you for reading!\nBut what happens when the church *doesn’t* offer you community? 👀"
